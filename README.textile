h1. Overview

Its a pull of the code from the gosu-lang download so it can be forked, etc...

h2. Reasons

* Experiment with it
* Eventually see if its feasible to make an ecma script compiler with it.

h2. TODOs

* Find the code, interestingly enough only code is to build the jars/gw-gosu-core-api.jar
* Figure out the build
* create a build script
* build ext jars /ext/ (based on copies of libs under a gw/internal/ext/ structure within the jar) 
** gw-commons-collections-3.2.1.jar - based off a copy of commons collections 
** gw-commons-logging-1.1.1.jar - commons logging copy
** gw-jetty-6.1.26RC0.jar - jetty copy
** gw-jetty-util-6.1.26RC0.jar - jetty util  copy
** gw-webservices.jar - some xml stuff, need to reverse engineer
** gw-xercesImpl-2.9.1.jar - xerces impl under the funky dir
** gw-xml.jar - this is a weird xml dir jar, need to reverse engineer


Dependencies are:
* servlet-api.jar
* TBD
