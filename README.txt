WELCOME

SDK version of Java. For Java downloads, visit http://java.com 

2. Expand the gosu.zip download file into its own directory.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

If you run the Gosu command-line tool without any arguments, Gosu 
opens a code editor that lets you create and run Gosu scripts. This editor
understands the Gosu type system. It offers code completion of Gosu
code based on the available Gosu and Java types when you type a "." or
CTRL+SPACE.

Gosu also includes an interactive shell for writing and running lines of Gosu
by using the -i option:
   gosu -i
   
For more information, refer to the documentation for the Gosu shell:
